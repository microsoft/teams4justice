# Setup Court

## Prerequisites

Each court must be linked to an Organisation entity, which is described in this sample JSON file in git:
`/main/src/json/courts.json`

This includes the field `eventOrganiserEmail` which is the email address of the organiser who will be the sender for
email notifications of calendar events. This email address must be an AAD email account.
