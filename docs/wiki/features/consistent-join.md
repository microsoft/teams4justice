## Background

This documentation aims to provide deeper technical detail of the systems necessary to support the
[Consistent Join - Automatic Routing epic].

## Research

Research for this epic came from a spike on an existing C# implementation of a listener bot built for virtual courts
prototype. Since our project is in TypeScript, and there is no JavaScript/TS SDK for the Calling Service, additional
research was conducted into the raw API and structure of the Calling Notifications service. Assumptions: It was
initially discussed to not perform any Graph API calls within the Call Management Bot service, and instead to perform
them all through an abstracted Call Management Bot service. However, to maintain responsibility for bot related functions
within one place, we have decided the Call Management Bot will make a limited set of Graph API calls related to the
Azure Bot joining rooms. Examples of Graph API calls the Call Management Bot will make: joining the Azure Bot into a
call, cleaning up calls, etc. Examples of Graph API calls the Call Management
Bot will make through an abstracted Call Management Bot service: inviting(moving) a participant to their private party room
and removing them from the Reception Room.

## Plan

### Architecture

![consistent-join-architecture](../../images/consistent-join-architecture.png)

### Configurations

### Azure Functions

Azure Functions is the serverless solution used to host the Call Management Bot business logic. It provides us with the
endpoint used as the webhook for directing all Calls Notifications from Teams calls to our Call Management Bot. To learn
about getting started with creating and publishing Azure Functions, see [Quickstart: Create a function in Azure with
TypeScript using Visual Studio
Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-typescript). In addition to
HTTP calls, Azure Functions provides Event Grid bindings to receive and publish events. See [Azure Event Grid bindings
for Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-grid) for more.

### Bot Application Registration in Azure Active Directory

An Application Instance needs to be registered in the Azure Active Directory tenant which the bot will utilize when
making calls to the Microsoft Graph API. [For more details on creating this Application Instance please refer to the
Call Management Bot section of the Application Security documentation](../application-security.md#call-management-bot).

### Azure Bot Service

An Azure Bot participates in the Teams calls in order to receive the Calls Notifications for participant joins, updates,
removals, etc. When registering the bot, make sure to set the following:

1. Use existing app registration: In order to have control over management of our resources, we want to create the bot
   and the app registration separately. Choose "use an existing app registration" when configuring the bot using the
   AppID and Secret from [the App Registration step mentioned
   above](#bot-application-registration-in-azure-active-directory).
2. Calling webhook: We need to enable Calling capabilities in order for the Azure Bot to receive Calls Notifications.
   Enter the event grid endpoint from the call-management-bot Azure Function in the webhook field.
   ![configure-bot-calling](../../images/configure-bot-calling.png) This can be updated at any time by navigating to the
   bot in Azure portal, clicking on the Channels blade, then clicking Edit next to the Microsoft Teams channel.
3. Messaging Endpoint: The bot does not require the messaging endpoint to be enabled at this time.

### Deployment

The bot's Application Identity is currently expected to be registered manually per the details in the in the
[Bot Application Registration in Azure Active Directory](#bot-application-registration-in-azure-active-directory)
section.

> NOTE: this _can_ be automated, it was decided to be lower priority for the first version because it only needed to be
> performed once per environment.

Registration with the Azure Bot Service is currently expected to be performed manually per the details in the
[Azure Bot Service](#azure-bot-service) section.

> NOTE: this _can_ be automated, it was decided to be lower priority for the first version because it only needed to be
> performed once per environment.

The bot's implementation is deployed as a set of Azure Functions using our standard Azure Functions automated deployment
CI/CD workflow in GitHub.

## Bot Features/Responsibilities

### Room Online Meeting Lifecycle Management

The bot is responsible for starting the meetings in advance so that no participant will ever join an empty meeting and
to ensure that the bot receives all notifications for the call from start to finish.

To do this the bot, upon learning about a new Online Meeting becoming available for a room (case or hearing), will
schedule itself to join the room well in advance of any other participants joining. The exact time is not documented
here as it may change, but it's reasonable to expect, for example, at least 24-48hrs in advance.

#### Initialization on Room Creation

When the bot hears that a new room is created via either `CaseRoomCreated` or `HearingRoomCrated`, it needs to prepare
itself by creating state based off the data provided by those events so that it can effectively prepare to manage the
meeting lifetimes once it receives the `CaseRoomOnlineMeetingInfoAvailable` and `HearingRoomOnlineMeetingInfoAvailable` events.

#### Activates w/Room OnlineMeeting Info Available Events

Once the bot is notified about the online meeting info being available, it should have all the information it needs
to schedule itself to joining call via the Graph API.

##### Implementation details

When the bot joins the online meeting, it provides a `callbackUrl` which we will utilize to correlate domain specific
details in the Call Notification Processing logic. The callback URL should be set with the following structure:

| Room Type    | URL scheme                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Case Room    | `https://<notification-handler-function-baseUrl>/case/<caseId>/rooms/<caseRoomType>`                                          |
| Hearing Room | `https://<notification-handler-function-baseUrl>/case/<caseId>/hearings/<hearingId>/rooms/<hearingRoomId>/<participantParty>` |
| Solo Room    | `https://<notification-handler-function-baseUrl>/case/<caseId>/hearings/<hearingId>/rooms/solo/<soloRoomId>`                  |

### Producing Room Participant Joined/Left Integration Events

As participants join and leave the online meetings we need to calculate the deltas provided by the call notifications
and publish specific integration events for interested systems to consume.

### Producing Room Status Integration Events

> NOTE: ðŸš§ Not sure we really need this yet. Publishing of this event has been disabled in latest version until
> we understand better. ðŸš§

When the bot joins a meeting it goes through a lifecycle of events that indicate when it is officially connected to the
meeting. These events can be treated as status events so that interested systems can track what state a particular room
is in with respect to the online meeting.

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NotificationHandler`  | Acts as the HTTP endpoint for Calling Notifications for the Azure Bot. Will receive JSON notifications via HTTP and relay them to the `CallManagementEntity` for processing. |
| `CallManagementEntity` | This is a durable entity function which is responsible for tracking the state of the online meeting's call. It has the following responsibilities:                           |

- Providing participant list delta processing and publishing logical `XXXOnlineMeetingParticipantJoined/Left`
  and `XXXOnlineMeetingParticipantMuteToggled` integration events based on those deltas
- Detecting state changes to the online meeting's call itself such as the the status changing. Today this is only used
  to react internally to a call being terminated.

### Reception Room Participant Routing

In order to know exactly which Hearing Room a participant entering the Reception room should be moved into the bot
will need to maintain some understanding of the room types and the participant types via state so that when it receives
the notification about the participant joining the call it knows how to route them. The following diagrams show the flow
of integration events that will come in from other parts of the system, how those will be routed to an entity which will
track the necessary state and how that entity will interact with Graph to move the participants to the call.

#### Notification of Case Rooms being created

This routing process is initially "started" by receiving `CaseRoomCreated` events...

<!-- generated by mermaid compile action - END -->

#### Notifications about Party Rooms being created for a Case

In order to route participants to the correct `HearingRoom` when they join the "reception" room we also need to watch
for `HearingRoomCreated` and associate more details with the same entity as the `CaseRoomCreated` event. Specifically we
need to build a mapping of which participants will be in which rooms so that when they come into the "reception" room we
know where to route them.

#### Notifications about each Room's Online Meeting Info becoming available

As each room's online meeting is created we will receive a notification in the form of both `CaseRoomOnlineMeetingInfoAvailable`
for both the "case" and "reception" Case Rooms and `HearingRoomOnlineMeetingInfoAvailable` for each distinct Hearing Room.
We need to handle those and update our internal state with the details of those online meetings.

reception room directly into the target room for their party or, if no target room exists, a solo room.

##### Resolving participants to Hearing Invitees by email

Invitees are matched by attempting to resolve the AAD User from the configured AAD "home" tenant. Assuming the User is
actually found, a case-insensitive comparison is done against the `mail` property _only_. This means that all Users of
the tenant need to be defined with the `mail` property set and not _just_ their `userPrincipalName`. External User's who
are invited to the tenant will always have their `mail` property set to whatever their external email address actually
is supplied as during hearing creation (i.e. `jane.doe@hotmail.com`).

A future enhancement to the resolution logic would be to use a fallback scheme of checking all three properties of the
AAD User in an attempt to match:`mail` -> `alternateMail` -> `userPrincipalName`.

#### "Solo" Room Routing

There are two scenarios which will result in a participant who joins the Case Reception Room will need to be routed into
a "solo" room.

- **Known Participants** - When a participant joins the Case Reception Room's online meeting and is successfully
  resolved to an invited `HearingParticipant`, but the participant party that they belong too does not have a dedicated
  `HearingRoom` then they should be moved into a solo room.
- **Unknown Participants** - When a participant joins the Case Reception Room's online meeting, but the system is unable
  to map the online meeting participant to a known `HearingParticipant`, either due to it being a phone dial in or not
  being able to resolve the online meeting participant's AAD identity against the originally invited set of
  `HearingParticipant`s, then the participant needs to be routed to a "solo" room where a moderator will eventually
  identify them and potentially move them out of later.

Both cases should be able to use the same following singular, data driven flow:

### Handling of Change Events

There are two change events which will result in a mutation of state in the Call Management Bot as well as updates to
timers in the Online Meeting Lifecycle Management Orchestrations.

- **HearingRescheduled** - When the schedule is changed for a hearing, a `HearingRescheduled` event is received by the
  Bot and updates are made to the hearing schedule in the Case Call Tracking Entity State. Concurrently, any existing
  timers in corresponding Online Meeting Lifecycle Management Orchestrations are updated as well.

### Room Call Keep-Alive

The bot has the responsibility of keeping the calls alive during the entirety of the scheduled hearing. Originally we
intended to do this with regular pings to [the Microsoft Graph `/keepAlive`
endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/call-keepalive?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http). However, when this
was implemented we noticed that the calls were still being terminated regardless of those pings. In speaking with the
Teams Product Group we learned that this endpoint was deprecated and does not work.

Instead logic was added to the Call Management Entity to detect the status of the call transitioning into the terminated
state. Upon this happening, the Call Management Entity will raise a `callTerminated` external event to the [Solo RoomÂ¹]
Online Meeting Lifecycle Orchestration instance that corresponds to the call. When the orchestration receives this event
it checks to see if the call should actually be terminated yet and, if not, will start the process of rejoining the call
immediately.

> Â¹The Solo Room version of the orchestration does not do anything with this event today because if a Solo Room
> call is terminated it means the user was no longer there and we shouldn't bother keeping it alive any longer any way
> since we currently recreate new Online Meetings and Calls each time a Solo Room is needed any way. In the future, if
> we maintain these Solo Rooms longer, we will want to either augment the orchestration with support for this external
> event or, better yet, refactor it to use the same orchestration as the other room types so there is less duplication
> of logic.

## Testing

There are currently a small set of unit tests. Some of the functions are fully unit testable and others need a little
more work to abstract dependencies into parameters so that they can be invoked with fakes/mocks. For example, several
areas of the code still call the `getGraphClient()` factory method directly rather than receiving a `GraphClient` as a
parameter. More work should continue to refactor functions that are not yet fully unit testing friendly and then code
coverage can/should be expanded.

Additionally, several `.rest` files were created that allow for local integration testing of the functions that make up
the bot. These files either test a specific function on its own or drive a specific set of functions to test a specific
scenario. The former are usually co-located with the corresponding function source code while the latter can be found in
[the `e2e` folder at the root of the bot project](../../../src/call-management-bot/e2e).
