# Technical Design Template

<!--
This is for a feature/epic and not the entire project or an user story. The Game Plan would have some of this
information but as we flush out each feature/epic, there should be a technical design for it. The Game Plan is point
in-time document. Technical Design doc should be saved in wiki/repo so that it becomes the documentation for the
customer after the engagement ends.

Not all sections are required. These bullet points serve as a guide to help think through all aspects of the
feature/epic.
