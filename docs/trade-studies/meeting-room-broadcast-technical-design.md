## Overview

Create a technical design for a solution to enable the moderator to send a message to an online meeting's chat thread.

## Goals

- Detailed documentation of the design
- Alignment with the current architecture
- Leverage existing access privileges as much as possible
- This design assumes a fire and forget call for send message

## Assumptions

- The option of implementing [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/main/samples/typescript_nodejs)
  for the bot is already evaluated and dismissed
- Presently, Call Management Bot code only communicates with teams using Graph API. No Direct line integration is implemented
- Azure Bot Registration Channel is used as an orchestrator
- Existing Bot code does not use delegated (on behalf of) token.

## Considered solutions

### Using Call Management Bot (aligned with current design pattern)

The following diagram illustrates the considered option:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram %% diagram
  %% participant
  participant UI as User Interface
  participant REST as REST API Wrapper
  participant API as API (Auth Controller)
  participant EH as Event Grid
  participant GA as Call Management Bot
  participant MG as Microsoft Graph APIs
  %% Flow

  UI->>REST: Send Message
  activate UI
  activate REST
  REST->>API: Send Message
  activate API
  API->>EH: Send Message Command (Integration Event)
  activate EH

  deactivate UI
  EH->>GA: Subscribed Event (Send Message integration event)
  deactivate EH
  activate GA
  GA->>MG: Send Chat
  activate MG
  MG-->>GA: response
  deactivate MG
  deactivate GA
```

</details>
<!-- generated by mermaid compile action - END -->

#### Pros

- Aligned with existing asynchronous eventing pattern
- No dependency on Call Management Bot

#### Cons

- The Application token currently used by Call Management Bot can not be used to [send messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/chat-post-messages?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)
  to chat threads. Send message API requires a delegated token.
- Can't leverage existing identity on Call Management Bot to represent the moderator

### Using the Bot - Synchronous call

  %% participant
  participant UI as User Interface
  participant REST as REST API Wrapper
  participant API as API (Auth Controller)

  participant MG as Microsoft Graph APIs
  %% Flow

  UI->>REST: Send Message

  REST->>API: Send Message

     deactivate MG

     deactivate BA
  API-->>REST: Response

  deactivate API
  REST-->>UI: Response
  deactivate REST
  deactivate UI

```

<!-- generated by mermaid compile action - END -->

#### Pros

- Simple design. Very synchronous
- Fastest turn-around time
- No dependency on messaging infrastructure
- Very predictable and assured delivery
- Leverages existing Call Management Bot's identity to represent moderator

#### Cons

- Introduction of a new communication pattern
- Bot API tier does not exist. Current function in Call management Bot only have listeners wired to Event Grid. No HTTP
  endpoints are exposed.
- Less granular abilities to set retry logic and time to live on events
- We would need to implement authentication between API and Bot

### Using the Bot - Asynchronous call using Event Grid

  participant MG as Microsoft Graph APIs
  %% Flow

  UI->>REST: Send Message

  EH->>GA: Subscribed Event (Send Message integration event)
  deactivate EH
  activate GA
  GA->>MG: Send Chat
  activate MG
  MG-->>GA: response
  deactivate MG
  deactivate GA
```

</details>
<!-- generated by mermaid compile action - END -->

#### Pros

- Aligned with existing asynchronous eventing pattern
- Highly decoupled design
- No new type of endpoints exposed out of the Call Management Bot tier
- Event Grid can handle transient failures gracefully
- Leverages existing Call Management Bot's identity to represent moderator

#### Cons

- The Event Grid is only used for events, not commands. Sending a message is classified as a command. This may result in
  a potential violation of the architecture.
- Dependency on Call Management Bot

### Using the Bot - Asynchronous call using Storage/Service_Bus queues

  EH->>GA: Subscribed Event (Send Message integration event)
  deactivate EH
  activate GA
  GA->>MG: Send Chat
  activate MG
  MG-->>GA: response
  deactivate MG
  deactivate GA
```

</details>
<!-- generated by mermaid compile action - END -->

#### Pros

- Aligned with existing asynchronous eventing pattern
- Highly decoupled design
- Leverages existing Call Management Bot's identity to represent moderator
- Clear differentiation of commands and events communications
- We will have better throughput through the use of batching. Event grid could potentially introduce a delay and with
  user initiated actions we want them done ASAP

#### Cons

- New Storage Queue needs to be stood up
- Introduction of a new trigger for Call Management Bot functions
- Need to handle transient failures for synchronous operations
- Dependency on Call Management Bot

### Comparison

The table below summarizes the differences between the solutions:

| Solution                   | Complexity | New Pattern | New Infra Requirement | New Trigger |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Using Call Management Bot  | Low        | No          | No                    | No          |
| Using the Bot + API        | High       | Yes         | No                    | Yes         |
| Using the Bot + Event Grid | Low        | Yes         | No                    | No          |
| Using the Bot + Queue      | Medium     | Yes         | Yes                   | Yes         |

### Decision

After considering the existing architectural pattern, 'Using the Bot - Synchronous call (API)' is recommended as the
most efficient design.

### Graph API calls

The graph endpoint 'GET /me/onlineMeetings/{meetingId}' can be used to retrieve the meeting details
